## Home rental site

This is a pet project which I use as a hobby. The repository contains only part of the project for code demonstrating. There is also old version [here vdomikah.kz](http://vdomikah.kz), which is written in play framework in 2015. Now I am rewriting it to spring boot. The site helps to find rental apartments in resorts and appears on the first google's/yandex's page for some requests.

## Home rental site

This is a pet project which I use for practice. You can see one [here vdomikah.kz](http://vdomikah.kz). The site helps to find rental apartments in Burabay resort, which is placed near the capital of Kazakhstan. Site appears on first google's/yandex's page for some requests.

Initially it has been written in play framework 1.3. Now I am rewriting the project on spring boot.
